# Moveo Home Test

Project name: MoveoProject
Files in the project:
  * index.html
  * script.js: dynamic code.
  * style.css: design file.
  * music folder

This project objective is to create a page with 9 rows, each row is a channel which should represent
an audio loop.

During this project I learned new technolgies and sharpen my skills in other.
I got more fimiliar with GitHub and JavaScript. Things that were new to me was using CSS file, and design.
And alos things like onClick methods and eventListeners to detect when a button was pressed.

Short explenation on the project:
I used an array of all the audio names (with the number of elements that were given in the assignment), and an array of colors (of the same size), So it will be more dynamic to create the elements in the HTML file. 
Each audio line was created during loop iteration with an audio file, text, unique color, etc.

Attached to the buttom of the 9 audio lines there are three buttons: 
1. Play- playing all audio files simultaneously.
2. Stop- stops all playing songs and goes back to start.
3. Loop toggle (on/off)- activated all the playing songs to play in a loop. Songs will start playing again immediately after they end.

When a song is playing I marked it with a frame (width 1px).

I tried thinking abount the design, started with 9 different colors, red, blue, green etc. But it seemed the a gradient of green would be nicer.
I'm sure there is a lot to improve in my project, I'm open for feedback that would help my growth.

Thank you for the opertunity,

Yael Norman


Note: I saw that all the samples has to be the same length, I'm sorry that I didn't do it.
